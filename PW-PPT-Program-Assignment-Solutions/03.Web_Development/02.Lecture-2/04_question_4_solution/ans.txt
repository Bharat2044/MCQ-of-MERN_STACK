Q.4 Whats difference between Inline, Inline Block and block ?

Ans. In CSS, the display property is used to determine how an element is rendered on a web page. It 
offers several display values, including "inline," "inline-block," and "block," each with different 
characteristics. Here's an overview of the differences between these display values:

(1) Inline:
Inline elements do not start on a new line; they flow along with the surrounding content.
They only take up as much horizontal space as necessary to contain their content.
Height and width properties have no effect on inline elements.
Margins and padding can be applied to the left and right but not to the top and bottom.
Examples of inline elements are <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, and <img>.

(2) Inline-block:
Inline-block elements are similar to inline elements in that they flow along with the content.
However, they behave more like block-level elements in terms of their ability to have height, width, margins, and padding.
Inline-block elements stack horizontally if there is enough space; otherwise, they will wrap to a new line.
Inline-block is useful when you want elements to have block-level properties while still being able to flow inline.
Examples of inline-block elements include <input>, <button>, and <div> (when explicitly set to inline-block).

(3) Block:
Block-level elements start on a new line and occupy the full width available.
They stack vertically, one after another.
Block elements can have width, height, margins, padding, and other block-level properties applied to them.
By default, block-level elements take up the full width available, but their width can be modified using CSS properties.
Examples of block-level elements are <div>, <p>, <h1>-<h6>, <ul>, and <li>.
