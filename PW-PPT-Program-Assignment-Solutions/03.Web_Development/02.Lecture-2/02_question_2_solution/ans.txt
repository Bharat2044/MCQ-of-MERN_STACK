Q.2 What are the Different Types of Selectors in CSS & what are the advantages of them?

Ans. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) provides several types of selectors that allow you to target 
specific HTML elements for styling. Each selector has its own advantages and use cases. Here are

some commonly used types of selectors:
(1) Element Selector: This is the most basic type of selector that targets elements based on their HTML 
tag names. For example, to select all <h1> elements, you can use the selector h1. The advantage of 
element selectors is that they are simple and provide a broad targeting capability.

(2) Class Selector: The class selector selects elements based on the value of their "class" attribute. 
It is denoted by a period (.) followed by the class name. For example, to select all elements with 
the class "highlight", you would use the selector .highlight. Class selectors offer the advantage 
of being reusable, as multiple elements can share the same class, allowing you to apply consistent 
styles to them.

(3) ID Selector: The ID selector selects a specific element based on its unique "id" attribute value. 
It is denoted by a hash (#) followed by the ID name. For example, to select an element with the ID 
"logo", you would use the selector #logo. ID selectors have the advantage of being highly specific, 
targeting a single element uniquely. However, they should be used sparingly since an ID should be unique within a page.

(5) Attribute Selector: Attribute selectors target elements based on the presence or value of their 
attributes. They provide flexibility in selecting elements that meet specific attribute criteria. 
For example, [type="submit"] selects all elements with the attribute "type" set to "submit". 
Attribute selectors are advantageous when you need to style elements based on specific attributes.

(6) Descendant Selector: The descendant selector targets elements that are descendants of another 
element. It is represented by a space between two selectors. For example, div p selects all <p> 
elements that are descendants of a <div> element. Descendant selectors provide the advantage of 
targeting specific elements within a hierarchy.

(7) Pseudo-class Selector: Pseudo-classes select elements based on their state or relationship with 
other elements. They are preceded by a colon (:). For example, a:hover selects an anchor element 
when it is being hovered over by the mouse. Pseudo-class selectors allow you to apply styles 
dynamically based on user interactions or element states.

(8) Pseudo-element Selector: Pseudo-elements target specific parts of an element's content, allowing 
you to style them separately. They are also preceded by a colon (:). For example, ::before selects 
the virtual element that appears before the content of an element. Pseudo-element selectors provide 
the advantage of adding extra styling elements without modifying the HTML structure.

By using these different types of selectors, you can precisely target and style specific elements 
on a web page, providing flexibility, maintainability, and control over the appearance of your 
content.
