Q.1 Whatâ€™s Box Model in CSS ? 

Ans. The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that defines how 
elements on a web page are structured and displayed. It describes the properties and dimensions of 
an element's content, padding, border, and margin.

The box model consists of the following components:

(1) Content: It represents the actual content of an element, such as text, images, or other HTML 
elements. The content area's dimensions can be specified using properties like width and height.

(2) Padding: It is a transparent area around the content that separates it from the border. Padding is 
used to create space between the content and the border of an element. The padding's size can be 
set using properties like padding-top, padding-bottom, padding-left, and padding-right.

(3) Border: It is a line that surrounds the padding and content of an element. The border can have 
different styles, colors, and widths. The border's properties include border-style, border-color, 
and border-width.

(4) Margin: It is the transparent area outside the border of an element. Margins create space between 
elements. The margin's size can be specified using properties like margin-top, margin-bottom, 
margin-left, and margin-right.

By default, the width and height of an element in CSS refer only to the content area. However, the 
total dimensions of an element, including padding and border, can be calculated by adding the 
content width/height with the padding and border sizes.

The box model allows developers to control the layout and spacing of elements on a web page. It 
provides flexibility in adjusting the size, position, and appearance of elements by manipulating 
the content, padding, border, and margin properties.
