Q.8 Difference between absolute and relative and sticky and fixed position explain with example.

Ans. 
(1) 
Absolute Positioning:
Absolute positioning allows elements to be positioned relative to their closest positioned ancestor or the document itself if no positioned ancestor exists.
When an element is positioned absolutely, it is taken out of the normal document flow, meaning it does not affect the position of other elements.
Absolute positioned elements are placed using coordinates defined by the top, right, bottom, and left properties.

(2) Relative Positioning:
Relative positioning allows elements to be positioned relative to their normal position within the document flow.
When an element is positioned relatively, it still occupies its original space in the document flow, but can be shifted using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.
Relative positioning does not take the element out of the normal document flow, so other elements are still affected by its presence.

(3) Fixed Positioning:
Fixed positioning allows elements to be positioned relative to the browser window, regardless of scrolling.
When an element is positioned fixed, it is taken out of the normal document flow and remains fixed at its specified position even when the page is scrolled.
Fixed positioned elements are placed using coordinates defined by the top, right, bottom, and left properties.

(4) Sticky Positioning:
Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning.
It behaves like relative positioning until the element reaches a specified threshold, at which point it becomes fixed.
Sticky positioning is often used to create sticky headers or navigation bars that stick to the top of the viewport as the user scrolls.
Sticky positioned elements are placed using coordinates defined by the top, right, bottom, and left properties.
