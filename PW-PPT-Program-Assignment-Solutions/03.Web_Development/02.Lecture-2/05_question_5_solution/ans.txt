Q.5 How is Border-box different from Content Box?

Ans. "Border-box" and "content-box" are two different values for the CSS box-sizing property. They determine 
how the width and height of an element are calculated and how the content, padding, border, and margin are 
handled within that space. Here's how they differ:

(1) Content-box:
The default value of the box-sizing property is "content-box".
With content-box, the specified width and height of an element only include the content area.
The padding, border, and margin are added to the specified width and height.
In other words, the width and height values set on an element determine the size of the content area, and any
additional padding, border, or margin will increase the element's total size beyond the specified dimensions.

(2) Border-box:
When the box-sizing property is set to "border-box", the width and height of an element include the content area, padding, and border.
The padding and border are included within the specified width and height, so any changes to the padding or 
border do not affect the overall size of the element.
In this model, the specified width and height represent the total space occupied by the element, including 
its content, padding, and border. The margin is still added to the specified width and height, extending 
beyond the total size.
