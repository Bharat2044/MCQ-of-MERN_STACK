Q.3 What is VW/VH ?

Ans. VW (viewport width) and VH (viewport height) are CSS units that allow you to specify sizes relative to the 
dimensions of the viewport, which is the visible area of a web page in a browser window.

(1) VW (Viewport Width): The VW unit represents a percentage of the viewport's width. For example, 1vw is equal to 1% 
of the viewport width, 50vw is equal to 50% of the viewport width, and so on. This unit is useful when you want an 
element to dynamically adjust its size based on the width of the viewport.

(2) VH (Viewport Height): The VH unit represents a percentage of the viewport's height. Similar to VW, 1vh is equal to 
1% of the viewport height. It allows you to size elements based on the height of the viewport.

Both VW and VH units are commonly used in responsive web design to create layouts and elements that scale 
proportionally with the viewport size. They help in achieving a consistent and fluid design across different 
devices and screen sizes.
