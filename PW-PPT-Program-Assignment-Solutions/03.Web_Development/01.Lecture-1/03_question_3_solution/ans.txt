Q.3 Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?

Ans. 
HTML Tags:
Tags are the building blocks of HTML markup.
Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >).
They define the structure and formatting of the content within an HTML document.
Examples of tags include <html>, <head>, <body>, <p>, <div>, <a>, etc.
Tags can have attributes, which provide additional information or properties to the element they are applied to.

HTML Elements:
Elements are composed of tags, along with their content and any attributes.
Elements consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag (except for void elements).
The opening tag marks the beginning of an element and is represented by the tag name enclosed in angle brackets.
The closing tag marks the end of an element and is represented by the tag name preceded by a forward slash (/) enclosed in angle brackets.
The content of an element is the text, other elements, or multimedia within the opening and closing tags.
Examples of elements include <p>Some text</p>, <div><h1>Heading</h1><p>Paragraph</p></div>, <a href="https://example.com">Link</a>, etc.
