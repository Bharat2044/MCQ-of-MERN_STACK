Q.8 What is the difference between <figure> tag and <img> tag?

Ans. The <figure> tag and the <img> tag serve different purposes in HTML.

<img> tag:
The <img> tag is used to embed an image into an HTML document. It is a self-closing tag and
does not require a closing tag. The <img> tag has attributes such as src (to specify the
image URL), alt (to provide alternative text for accessibility and when the image cannot be
loaded), width, height, etc. It is primarily used to display images within the content of a webpage.

Example:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Example Image" width="300" height="200">


<figure> tag:
The <figure> tag represents a self-contained content block that is typically used to encapsulate 
and provide a caption or description for media content like images, illustrations, videos, 
audio, etc. It is often used in conjunction with the <figcaption> tag to provide the caption
for the media content.

Example:
<figure>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Example Image">
  <figcaption>This is an example image</figcaption>
</figure>

The key difference is that the <img> tag is specifically for embedding images, while the
<figure> tag is used to group and provide additional information about a self-contained block 
of content, which can include images, videos, audio, and more. The <figure> tag allows for 
better organization and semantic representation of multimedia content with associated 
captions or descriptions.
