Q.1 <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?

Ans. Yes, <!DOCTYPE html> is indeed a tag in HTML, although it is not technically an HTML element.
It is called a Document Type Declaration (DTD) and is used to specify the version of HTML or XHTML 
being used in a web page.

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration specifically refers to the HTML5 standard. It is typically placed at 
the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag, to inform the browser about the version 
of HTML being used and to ensure proper rendering and interpretation of the markup.

The declaration helps the browser understand how to parse and render the HTML code. 
It also helps in triggering the standards mode of rendering, which ensures consistent 
rendering across different browsers. By using the HTML5 doctype, you are essentially instructing 
the browser to treat the document as HTML5 and follow the rules and specifications defined by the 
HTML5 standard.

In summary, <!DOCTYPE html> is a necessary part of an HTML document to indicate that it follows 
the HTML5 standard and to ensure correct rendering and interpretation by web browsers.
