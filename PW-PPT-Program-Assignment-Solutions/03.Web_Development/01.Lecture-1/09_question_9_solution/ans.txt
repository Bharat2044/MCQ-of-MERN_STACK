Q.9 Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some global attributes?

Ans. In HTML, there is a distinction between HTML tags and attributes. Here's an explanation of each, along with examples of global attributes:

HTML Tag:
HTML tags are the fundamental building blocks of an HTML document.
Tags are represented by opening and closing angle brackets < > and enclose content or other elements.
They define the structure and semantics of the content within an HTML document.
Examples of HTML tags include <html>, <head>, <body>, <p>, <div>, <a>, etc.

HTML Attribute:
HTML attributes provide additional information or modify the behavior of HTML elements.
Attributes are specified within the opening tag of an element and consist of a name-value pair.
They provide extra details, instructions, or properties to the element they are applied to.
Examples of attributes include class, id, src, href, alt, style, etc.

Global Attributes:
Global attributes are attributes that can be used with any HTML element. Here are some examples:

class: Specifies one or more CSS class names to apply to an element for styling or JavaScript manipulation.
Example: <div class="container">...</div>

id: Provides a unique identifier for an element, allowing it to be targeted by JavaScript or CSS.
Example: <h1 id="page-title">Welcome!</h1>

style: Inline CSS styles to apply directly to an element for styling purposes.
Example: <p style="color: red;">This is some text.</p>

title: Provides additional information or a tooltip for an element when the user hovers over it.
Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Example" title="This is an example image.">

data-*: Allows the addition of custom data attributes for storing data that can be accessed via JavaScript.
Example: <div data-user-id="123">John Doe</div>

aria-*: Used for providing accessibility-related information to assistive technologies.
Example: <button aria-label="Close">X</button>
