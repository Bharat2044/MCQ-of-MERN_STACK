Q.1 What is a Media Query in CSS, and what is its purpose?

Ans. A media query in CSS is a technique that allows you to apply different styles to a webpage 
based on certain characteristics of the device or browser being used to view the page. It allows 
you to create responsive designs that adapt and optimize the layout and presentation of content for 
different screen sizes and devices.

The purpose of media queries is to enable the creation of websites that can adapt to different 
devices and provide an optimal user experience across a range of screen sizes, resolutions, and 
orientations. With media queries, you can specify different CSS rules to be applied based on 
factors such as the width and height of the viewport, the device's screen resolution, the type of 
device (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile), or even the user's preferred color scheme.

By using media queries, you can create stylesheets that target specific devices or adapt to changes 
in the viewport size, allowing you to rearrange or resize elements, hide or show certain content, 
or modify the styling to fit different display contexts. This flexibility helps ensure that your 
website looks and functions well on various devices, providing a consistent and user-friendly 
experience to your audience.
