Q.2 How do you define a media query in CSS?

Ans. In CSS, you define a media query using the @media rule followed by a set of conditions or 
rules that specify when the styles inside the media query should be applied. Here's the general 
syntax of a media query:

@media media-type and (media-feature) {
  /* CSS rules to be applied when the media query conditions are met */
}


Let's break down the different parts of a media query:

@media: This is the keyword that indicates the start of a media query.

media-type: This specifies the type of media being targeted. It can be one of several values, such 
as all (default), screen, print, speech, etc. The screen media type is commonly used for targeting 
devices with screens, like computers and mobile devices.

media-feature: This is the condition or criteria based on which the media query will be evaluated. 
Media features can include characteristics like viewport width, device width, screen resolution, 
orientation, etc.

Here's an example of a media query that targets screens with a maximum width of 768 pixels:

@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  /* CSS rules to be applied when the screen width is 768 pixels or less */
}


Inside the curly braces, you can place the CSS rules that will be applied when the conditions 
specified in the media query are met. These rules can include changes to the layout, typography, 
colors, or any other styling adjustments you want to make for the targeted devices or screen sizes.

It's worth noting that you can have multiple media queries in your CSS file, allowing you to create 
different styles for different device characteristics or combinations of conditions. This way, you 
can provide customized styles for various breakpoints and ensure your website looks good on a range 
of devices.
