Q.4 What is the purpose of using Media Queries for Print Media?

Ans. The purpose of using media queries for print media is to create styles specifically optimized for printing a web page. Media queries provide a way to apply different CSS rules when a webpage is being printed, allowing you to customize the appearance and layout to ensure the content is properly formatted for print.

When users choose to print a webpage, they often have different requirements compared to viewing it on a screen. 
Print media queries enable you to adjust the styling and layout to optimize the printed output. Here are some 
common use cases and purposes of using media queries for print media:

(1) Adjusting Layout: Media queries allow you to modify the layout of the page for print. You can hide or rearrange 
elements that are not necessary or may not make sense in a printed version. For example, you might want to remove 
navigation menus, sidebars, or advertisements to make the printed content more focused and readable.

(2) Styling for Print: Media queries enable you to define specific styles for print, such as adjusting font sizes, 
line heights, margins, and colors. You can choose styles that work better in the printed format, ensuring optimal 
readability and preserving the overall visual integrity of the content.

(3) Controlling Page Breaks: With media queries, you can control how content is divided across pages when printed. 
You can specify where page breaks should occur, preventing awkward content splitting or ensuring that certain 
sections always start on a new page.

(4) Hiding or Showing Content: Media queries allow you to selectively hide or show certain elements when the page is 
printed. This can be useful for removing unnecessary content that is only relevant to the screen version, or for 
including additional information that is specific to the print version.

By utilizing media queries for print media, you can create a more print-friendly version of your web page, 
enhancing its readability and usability when it is printed out. This helps ensure that your content is 
well-presented and can be easily consumed in a physical format.
